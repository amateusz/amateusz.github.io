as I don't do web dev, it could be anything. // 
## [IT WORKS](http://amateusz.github.io) (fully on big computing devices only tbh)


### GOATS

any key: pop-up search

mouse click: place random gif from search results over here
drag left click: rotate slowly clockwise

## **_special !!_**:
* plain scroll          ->  funny transform
* CTRL + scroll         ->  zoom (scaling)
* ALT (OPTION) + scroll ->  rotate. point direction with scrolling. I know, it's tricky


_uses P5.js_
